# Databases and Big Data 2023-2024: Project

**Professors:** Blerina Sinaimeri, Valerio Rughetti, and Marco Esposito  
**Grade:** 50% of the grade + bonus point 10% of the grade  
**Start Date:** October 4, 2023

## 1. Key Dates
- **Handed out:** October 4, 2023
- **Submission of ER Diagram (Deliverable 1):** October 27, 2023 (before 11:59 PM)
- **Submission of SQL and Python Application (Deliverable 2):** December 1, 2023 (before 11:59 PM)
- **Submission of CRUD on MongoDB and Python Application (Deliverable 2):** December 1, 2023 (before 11:59 PM)

## 2. Objective of the Project
The goal is to provide students with hands-on experience in designing and implementing relational and NoSQL databases, and developing Python applications to query and analyze real-world datasets. Students will learn to model data using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, create relational databases using SQL, create MongoDB databases using CRUD calls, and build Python applications for data retrieval and analysis.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Deliverable 1 - ER Diagram
#### 3.1.1 Select a Dataset
Groups must select a dataset from the provided list or source independently with approval from the instructor or teaching assistants.

#### 3.1.2 Design an ER Diagram
Design an ER diagram representing the datasetâ€™s structure, including entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities.

#### 3.1.3 Submit ER Diagram
Submit the ER diagram digitally on luiss.learn and discuss it in a short meeting with the instructor. All group members must participate.

### 3.2 Deliverable 2 - SQL and Python Applications
#### 3.2.1 SQL Code
Create a database schema with SQL code based on the ER diagram and develop SQL queries for data analysis.

#### 3.2.2 NoSQL Aggregations and Grouping
Write CRUD code to create a database schema and develop NoSQL queries for data analysis.

#### 3.2.3 Python Applications
Develop Python applications for loading data into SQL and NoSQL databases and for executing queries, with a simple user interface and clear instructions.

### 3.3 Prepare for In-Class Presentation
Prepare a presentation with an overview, dataset description, task analysis, visualization demonstration, and main findings. Be ready for questions and discussions.

## 4. Submission and Evaluation
Projects will be evaluated based on the correctness of the ER diagram, the effectiveness of SQL and NoSQL queries, the functionality and usability of Python applications, and the handling of the presentation and questions.

Good luck!
