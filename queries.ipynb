    "### Exploring Our Python Script for Crime Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In our group project, we've developed a Python script that features a function called `execute_query`. This function establishes a connection to a MySQL database and is capable of executing a range of queries related to crime data in Boston. The script offers an interactive experience, allowing users to select and run specific queries of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, let's delve deeper into the detailed workings of each part of the `execute_query` function in our group's Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Connection and Cursor Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Connection:**\n",
    "  The function begins by establishing a connection to the MySQL database using `mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)`. This connection is based on the database configuration (`db_config`) provided as a parameter, which includes host, user, password, and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cursor Initialization:**\n",
    "  A cursor (`cursor = db.cursor(buffered=True)`) is created for the database connection. This cursor is used to execute queries and fetch results. The `buffered=True` parameter ensures that the server buffers the full result set and sends it to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Different Queries Based on User Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query 1 - High Crime Areas by Time:**\n",
    "  The user is prompted to choose between 'day' or 'night'. This choice determines the time condition in the query (`time_condition`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The query fetches the district and street with the highest crime count based on the specified time frame (day or night). This is accomplished by joining the `Incidents` and `Place` tables and grouping the results by district and street.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query 2 - Yearly Crime Trends:**\n",
    "  This query analyzes crime trends year-on-year by calculating the percentage change in total crimes. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The `LAG` window function is used to compare the total crimes of each year with the previous year.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Results include the year, total crimes for that year, and the percentage change from the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query 3 - Most Occurring Crime Types:**\n",
    "  It identifies the top three most common crime types by joining the `Crime_Types` and `Incidents` tables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The query groups the results by crime type and orders them by the total number of occurrences, returning the top three most frequent crime types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query 4 - Area and Shootings for a Specific Street:**\n",
    "  This query allows the user to input a street name (or choose a random one) to analyze shootings and general safety.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  It checks if the street exists in the database, and then retrieves data on shootings for that street by joining `Place` and `Incidents` and grouping by area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query 5 - Random Fact about Crime Data:**\n",
    "  A random fact is chosen from a set of predefined queries about crime data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  These queries provide diverse insights, such as the total number of incidents, most recent incidents, district or street with the most incidents, total number of shootings, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The script selects and executes one of these queries randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling:**\n",
    "  - The `try-except` block captures any errors that occur during database operations, such as connection issues or query execution errors. If an error occurs, it's printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Closing Resources:**\n",
    "  - The `finally` block ensures that the cursor and database connection are closed properly, which is crucial for resource management and preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function is designed to interact with users, offering them a choice of queries to execute and handling their inputs to provide relevant crime data insights. This interactive nature makes the script user-friendly and accessible for non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed breakdown explains the intricate workings of our group's script, highlighting how it efficiently interacts with the database to provide valuable insights into crime data in Boston.\n",

    "The `main` function in your Python script serves as the central entry point for a console-based application that interacts with a MySQL database to provide insights into crime data in Boston. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Configuration:**\n",
    "   The `db_config` dictionary holds the configuration for connecting to the MySQL database. It includes the hostname (`'localhost'`), username, password, and the database name (`'BostonCrimes'`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   These details are essential for establishing a database connection and should be updated with actual credentials for the database to be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Infinite Loop for User Interaction:**\n",
    "   The `while True` loop creates an infinite loop, making the script continuously prompt the user for input until explicitly exited. This is a common way to keep a console application running and responsive to user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Displaying Options and ASCII Art:**\n",
    "   At the start of each loop iteration, the script displays `ascii_art` (a predefined string or function that prints ASCII art, presumably representing the application or related to Boston crimes).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   It then prints a menu of options, each corresponding to a different query about crime data in Boston. The options range from 1 to 5, each representing a specific query, and 0 for exiting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Input for Query Selection:**\n",
    "   The script prompts the user to enter their choice of query (a number between 0 and 5) using the `input` function. This choice is stored in the variable `choice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling User Choice:**\n",
    "   The script first checks if the user entered '0'. If so, the `break` statement is executed, which exits the infinite loop and ends the program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If the user enters a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive), the script calls the `execute_query` function, passing in the `db_config` and the user's choice converted to an integer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The `execute_query` function is expected to handle the logic for connecting to the database and executing the corresponding query based on the number provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Invalid Choice Handling:**\n",
    "   If the user enters anything other than the numbers 0-5, the script prints an error message prompting the user to make a valid choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Continued Execution:**\n",
    "   After executing a query or printing an error message, the script loops back to the beginning, displaying the options again. This process repeats until the user chooses to exit by entering '0'.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Script Entry Point:**\n",
    "   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block checks if the script is being run as the main program (as opposed to being imported as a module in another script). If it is the main program, it calls the `main` function to start the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure provides a user-friendly way to interact with the database, allowing users to choose and execute queries through a simple text interface, making the script accessible even to those who may not be familiar with programming or databases."
